# About

This is an isomorphic react app, displaying stories from hackernews made with super nice [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/master/README.md).

It's just about 100 lines of code.

Nothing serious, just for fun :)

# Developing

```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```

# Todo

- Make the data fetching faster (how?)
- Add loading indicator
- Add super simple cache (service worker?) for data.
- Add tests
